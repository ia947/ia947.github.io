I offer specialised technical advisory services at the intersection of environmental science, high-performance computing, and data analysis. My expertise is ideal for organisations that need to leverage advanced modelling and robust statistical analysis but lack the in-house capacity.

I bridge the gap between academic research and practical application, delivering actionable insights and tools.

## My Offerings

### 1. Custom Environmental Data Analysis
Does your organisation have complex, repetitive data tasks? I develop automated, reproducible workflows in Python and R to clean, process, and analyse large environmental datasets (hydrological, climatic, geospatial), saving you time and reducing errors.
*   **Technologies:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy), R, Jupyter, Bash
*   **Deliverable:** Well-documented, reusable code and a final report with key insights.

### 2. Probabilistic Forecasting & Uncertainty Quantification
Is your model's output a single, uncertain number? I can help you quantify and communicate that uncertainty. I build and audit models that produce probabilistic forecasts, which are essential for robust risk management and decision-making in fields like flood and drought prediction.
*   **Technologies:** Statistical Modelling, Bayesian Methods, Machine Learning (TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
*   **Deliverable:** A model or audit report that provides confidence intervals and probabilistic outputs.

### 3. Hybrid Physics-ML Model Development
Looking to innovate beyond traditional models? I specialise in developing hybrid models that combine physical process understanding with the pattern-recognition power of machine learning. This approach often leads to more accurate and computationally efficient forecasts.
*   **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Numerical Modelling
*   **Deliverable:** A proof-of-concept or production-ready hybrid model.

### 4. Research & Development Collaboration
Need external expertise for a short-term project? I partner with companies and NGOs on feasibility studies, method development, and grant proposals, bringing a cutting-edge academic perspective to applied problems.
*   **Deliverable:** A technical report, a prototype, or a collaborative research proposal.
